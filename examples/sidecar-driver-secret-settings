# A secret with the content of this is supposed to be created in case
# Cassandra is on SSL and you want to use Sidecar operations which are using CQL in the background.
# Once such operation is executed, CqlSession will be dynamically initialized by fetching this secret.
#
# Create this secret like the following:
#
# kubectl create secret generic cassandra-operator-sidecar-secret-test-dc-cassandra --from-file=cassandra-config=sidecar-driver-secret-settings
#
# name of a secret has to follow the convention: "cassandra-operator-sidecar-secret-{name of Cassandra datacenter}"
#
# --from-file key has to be "cassandra-config"
# --from-file value of "cassandra-config" key points to this file
#
# Eventually, you want your secret to look like this:
#
# $ kubectl describe secret cassandra-operator-sidecar-secret-test-dc-cassandra
# Name:         cassandra-operator-sidecar-secret-test-dc-cassandra
# Namespace:    default
# Labels:       <none>
# Annotations:  <none>
#
# Type:  Opaque
#
# Data
# ====
# cassandra-config:  140 bytes
